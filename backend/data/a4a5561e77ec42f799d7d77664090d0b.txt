Artificial Intelligence (AI) in remote sensing enhances the analysis and interpretation of satellite and aerial imagery by automating complex tasks such as land cover classification, change detection, object recognition, and environmental monitoring. Using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, AI can extract meaningful patterns from vast amounts of multispectral or hyperspectral data with high accuracy and speed. This enables more efficient applications in agriculture, urban planning, disaster management, and climate studies, transforming raw remote sensing data into actionable insights for decision-making.
