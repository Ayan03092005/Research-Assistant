Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

Artificial Intelligence has become a significant force in transforming modern healthcare systems. From diagnosis to treatment planning, AI algorithms help doctors make faster and more accurate decisions. For example, deep learning models can detect pneumonia from chest X-rays and identify tumors from MRI scans within seconds.

AI applications extend to administrative tasks as well. Hospitals now use AI chatbots to schedule appointments, manage patient records, and provide health advice. These tools reduce workload for staff and improve efficiency in patient care.
